His prominent features are his two sharp canine teeth, which gives him a savage demeanor when he grins. He wears the standard Toman Toppuku while with the gang. As a member of Valhalla, he wears its white bomber jacket with a Valhalla logo on the back.</li>

Mitsuya is a pacifist, preferring to not get into an altercation if possible, but at the same time, will not hesitate to fight in order to protect what is dear to him.</li>

He bears a small stitch on the leftmost side of his lower lip and a small scar under his left eye. He is most often seen wearing the traditional Toman uniform.

                    <li class="des">Kazutora is a very broken soul; as a child, he was forced to pick between his mom and dad in a case of domestic violence. As a result of his fundamentally non-existent family life, he scorned upon other happy families. Something as simple as seeing children having tender moments with their parents, triggered a sore spot within Kazutora and irritated him deeply.</li>
