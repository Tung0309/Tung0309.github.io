              <h2>About us</h2>
              <h1>Tokyo Manji Gang</h1>
              <p>The Tokyo Manji Gang (東京卍會, Tōkyō Manji-Kai?), otherwise known as Toman, was a biker gang lead by Manjiro "Mikey" Sano & Ken "Draken" Ryuguji.</p>
            </div>
          <div class="s4">
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The gang's initial identity was a grade-school biker friend group formed by six middle-school friends from schools around Tokyo.<br>

              Toman was founded on June 19 with Baji's idea of making their own gang in order to be able to fight the Black Dragons. Their gang was founded with the motto, "If one of us gets hurt, we'll protect them... a gang that's all for one, one for all."<br>
              
              Toman started out as a group of middle-schoolers: Mikey, Draken, Baji, Mitsuya, Pah-chin, and Kazutora. Back then, they rode their bikes around, searching for fun and just having a good time in general. They would constantly banter and play pranks on each other,<br>
              but it was all in good faith. In 2003, Mitsuya created the uniforms that would become the official Toman uniform a few years later and the iconic photo of the founders was taken.
              
              A few days before Mikey's birthday, Kazutora wants to steal a better bike for Mikey and convinces a begrudging Baji to go along with them. They almost steal the bike, but the shop owner catches them. To prevent themselves from getting arrested,<br> 
              Kazutora hits him with a wrench, but accidentally kills him. Kazutora snaps from the ordeal and is sent to a reform school. The naive and pure Toman was no more.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="s5">
            <h2>Structure</h2>
            <p>Toman is led by Mikey and Draken as leader and vice-leader, respectively. There are five divisions which comprises around 20 guys each.</p>
            <div class="nicep">
                First Division - This division is co-led by Keisuke Baji and Kazutora Hanemiya and at the time of the Gang's foundation, was intended as an "attack unit".<br>
                Following the events of Valhalla, the First Division is now led by Takemichi Hanagaki.<br>
                <br>
                Second Division - Led by Takashi Mitsuya, the second division was originally intended to be the gang's "elite guard".<br>
                <br>
                Third Division - The third division is led by Pah-chin, the original Flag Bearer of the gang. The division seems to specialize in brute force.<br>
                <br>
                Fourth Division - Led by Smiley, not much informations are knew about this division.<br>
                <br>
                Fifth Division - The division led by Mucho, is a "special task division" that allowed infighting. They are considered Toman's "Public Morality Council".<br>
                They can punish any traitors in Toman without the leader's decree.<br>
                <br>
                Sixth Division - A temporary sixth division was created after the gang absorbed the Moebius and Valhalla gang members. It was led by Shuji Hanma who previously had acted as leader of both rival gangs.<br>
                After Hanma left Toman, he took his subordinates with him and the division was disbanded.</p>

            <h2>Trivia</h2>
            <div class="trivia1">
              <li>Manji (卍) - crux gammata also known as swastika symbol, is an ancient religious icon in the cultures of<br>
                Eurasia. It was used as a symbol of divinity and spirituality in Indian religions, including Hinduism,<br>
                Buddhism and Jainism. The name is derived from the Sanskrit svastika (meaning "welfare," from su - "well"<br>
                + asti "he is").<br>
              </li>
            </div>
            <div class="trivia2">
              <li>
                As a symbol of prosperity and good fortune, the swatstika was widely used throughout the ancient<br>
                world (for example, appearing often on Mesopotamian coinage), including North and South America<br>
                and has been used in Japan as a symbol of Buddhism since ancient times. To be precise, the symbol<br>
                generally used by Japanese Buddhism is the sauvatika, which moves in a counterclockwise direction,<br>
                and is called the manji in Japanese.<br>
              </li>
            </div>
            <div class="trivia3">
              <li>
                The arms of the swastika, which point in a clockwise direction (卐), are generally considered a<br>
                solar symbol. It was this version (the hakenkreuz) that was perverted by the Nazis. The<br>
                sauvastika generally stands for night, rituals and often for magical practices.<br>
